# TADS 3 Playground

This repository contains a simplified distribution of [TADS 3](https://tads.org/). This includes the system and base include libraries as well as the executables for Mac and Windows systems.

This distribution does not currently contain any of the available "adventure game libraries." That means this distribution does not contain ADV3 or ADV3LITE. The reason for this is because this playground is actually helping me to develop my own TADS 3 library.

So what this distribution does is allow for you to use any library you want that extends the system and standard libraries.

The TADS software itself is "freeware." This means that it's copyrighted software distributed for use free of charge but subject to certain restrictions. The individual TADS software packages include license text files that provide full details. The main thing to understand is that any of the TADS-specific elements in this repository retain their copyright to Michael J. Roberts who developed the system.

Beyond being distributed at the above link, all of the TADS 3 software is available within the ["tads3" area of the if-archive](https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/programming/tads3/).
